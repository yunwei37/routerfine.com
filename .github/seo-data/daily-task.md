# Daily SEO task

## Objective

Run one fully autonomous, evidence-backed SEO operating cycle for the site in
`site.md`. No normal step requires human approval.

## Schedule

- Frequency: daily
- Timezone: use `site.md`
- Data window: use the lookback and finalization lag in `site.md`
- Maximum site changes: one coherent change per main pull request

## Required sequence

1. Read the pinned `$collect-seo-data` skill, `$change-seo-site` when a site
   change is justified, all `.github/seo-data/*.md` files, and newest reports.
2. Fetch the remote default branch and create a fresh branch from it.
3. Check whether the `seo-skills` submodule has an allowed update and include an
   available update in the same main pull request.
4. Collect finalized Google Drive and Cloudflare evidence without committing
   raw data or private identifiers.
5. Write or append `.github/seo-data/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`; refresh `status.md`,
   maintain future work in `plan.md`, and keep `block.md` limited to genuine
   human-only or permission blockers.
6. When evidence supports a site improvement, implement at most one coherent
   change and define its production acceptance check before editing.
7. Validate locally, push the branch, and create a real non-draft pull request.
8. Wait for all required and expected CI, self-review the complete final diff,
   fix and repeat if needed, then squash-merge and delete the branch.
9. For a site change, wait for the exact squash commit to deploy successfully
   and verify the changed behavior on the public site.
10. Open a metadata-only closeout pull request with final evidence; wait for CI,
    self-review, and squash-merge it.
11. Continue autonomously while safe progress is possible. Record a `block.md`
    item only when an external system enforces a human-only action or required
    permission is absent.

## Daily completion

A day is complete only after its main pull request and closeout pull request are
squash-merged. A site-change day also requires a successful production
deployment for the exact squash commit and public verification. A failed or
missing CI check, failed deployment, local-only commit, issue, draft PR,
workflow URL, or HTTP 200 alone is not completion.
